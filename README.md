# eventstore
A project to implement an Event source driven api. 
The idea of the project is to let it grow over time, like an actual project. But also as a resource for topics I already investigated.

# How to run
* Start EventStore.Api project (with Visual Studio, set as start up project and press F5)
* Browse to: http://localhost:4000/swagger
